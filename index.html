        <h3>Why Not?</h3>
        <p>In December of 2015, I started playing bass in a Pop-Punk band called <strong>Why Not</strong>. We played our first show in May of this year. It was an awesome start as that we sold the show out with over 200 people in attendance.</p>

        <h3>This City of Takers</h3>
        <p>I formed <strong>This City of Takers</strong> in 2009. I play guitar and sing in the band. We've released 3 albums on Tower Groove records. We have opened for such national bands as Frank Black(of the Pixies), Tim Kasher(of Cursive), Cloud Nothings, Gringo Starr, Joe Lally(of Fugazi), and many many more.</p>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/KoWhE7QgcT0">Watch This City of Takers live on KDHX 88.1fm</a>
        <h3>Disputed</h3>
        <p>Disputed was my first real band. We playted together from 1998 through 2001. We did a reunion show in 2014 as well as 2015. We released one <a href="http://disputedrock.bandcamp.com">album</a>. During our time as a band we opened for such touring acts as Further Seems Forever, Ultimate Fake Book, Johnny Socko, Mu330, the Toasters, and more.</p>
