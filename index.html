        <h3>Why Not?</h3>
        <p>In December of 2015, I started playing bass in a Pop-Punk band called <strong>Why Not</strong>. We played our first show in May of this year. It was an awesome start as that we sold the show out with over 200 people in attendance. Our first single, <em>"Secrets"</em> will be released in September.</p>

        <h3>This City of Takers</h3>
        <p>I formed <strong>This City of Takers</strong> in 2009. I play guitar and sing in the band. We've released 3 albums on Tower Groove records. We have opened for such national bands as Frank Black(of the Pixies), Tim Kasher(of Cursive), Cloud Nothings, Gringo Starr, Joe Lally(of Fugazi), and many many more.
